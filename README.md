## Basic Details

### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Nandu S Kumar] - [College of Engineering Perumon,Kollam]
- Member 2: [Sundara Siva Sreerag] - [College of Engineering Perumon,Kollam]

### Project Description
This project combines an ESP8266-based Wi-Fi jammer with an ESP32-powered local web server to mimic a target Wi-Fi network and deliver a humorous, meme-based HTML page. When users connect, they are redirected to a fun, themed page filled with memes and dialogues for entertainment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People connect to Wi-Fi networks without getting enough daily memes, leading to severe meme deficiency and boredom.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a Wi-Fi imposter that hijacks your browsing journey and force-feeds you a glorious page of spicy memes and iconic Malayalam‚ÄìManglish dialogues, ensuring your laughter bandwidth is always full.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used]
      C (for ESP32 firmware)
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for meme page
- [Frameworks used]
      Arduino Core for ESP32
      NodeMCU firmware environment     
- [Libraries used]
      WiFi.h (ESP32 Wi-Fi control)
      DNSServer.h (to redirect to meme page)
      ESPAsyncWebServer.h (host the memes)
      ESP32 Deauther(SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther)
- [Tools used]
      Arduino IDE
      GitHub


For Hardware:
- [List main components]
    ESP32-WROOM-32 module
    NodeMCU board (ESP8266 variant)
- [List specifications]
    ESP32 Dual-core 240MHz ,Wi-Fi + Bluetooth, 4MB Flash
    NodeMCU with ESP8266, 80/160 MHz, 4MB Flash
- [List tools required]
    Micro-USB cable
    Laptop for flashing firmware
    jumper wires 



### Implementation
For Software:
The ESP32 is programmed to scan and jam Wi-Fi networks in range (educational/demo purposes only, of course). When a device tries to connect, a captive portal triggers and redirects the user to our custom meme webpage hosted on the ESP32. The meme page is pure HTML/JS, designed to make people laugh at their lack of internet instead of crying.
