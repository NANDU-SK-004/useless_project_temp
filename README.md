### Project Description
[This project combines an ESP8266-based Wi-Fi jammer with an ESP32-powered local web server to mimic a target Wi-Fi network and deliver a humorous, meme-based HTML page. When users connect, they are redirected to a fun, themed page filled with memes and dialogues for entertainment.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People connect to Wi-Fi networks without getting enough daily memes, leading to severe meme deficiency and boredom.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created a Wi-Fi imposter that hijacks your browsing journey and force-feeds you a glorious page of spicy memes and iconic Malayalam‚ÄìManglish dialogues, ensuring your laughter bandwidth is always full.]
