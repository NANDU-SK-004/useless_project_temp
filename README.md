## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Perilla]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Nandu S Kumar] - [College of Engineering Perumon,Kollam]
- Member 2: [Sundara Siva Sreerag] - [College of Engineering Perumon,Kollam]

### Project Description
This project combines an ESP8266-based Wi-Fi jammer with an ESP32-powered local web server to mimic a target Wi-Fi network and deliver a humorous, meme-based HTML page. When users connect, they are redirected to a fun, themed page filled with memes and dialogues for entertainment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People connect to Wi-Fi networks without getting enough daily memes, leading to severe meme deficiency and boredom.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a Wi-Fi imposter that hijacks your browsing journey and force-feeds you a glorious page of spicy memes and iconic Malayalam‚ÄìManglish dialogues, ensuring your laughter bandwidth is always full.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used
      C (for ESP32 firmware)
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for meme page
- Frameworks used
      Arduino Core for ESP32
      NodeMCU firmware environment     
- Libraries used
      WiFi.h (ESP32 Wi-Fi control)
      DNSServer.h (to redirect to meme page)
      ESPAsyncWebServer.h (host the memes)
      ESP32 Deauther(SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther)
- Tools used
      Arduino IDE
      GitHub


For Hardware:
- List main components
    ESP32-WROOM-32 module
    NodeMCU board (ESP8266 variant)
- List specifications
    ESP32 Dual-core 240MHz ,Wi-Fi + Bluetooth, 4MB Flash
    NodeMCU with ESP8266, 80/160 MHz, 4MB Flash
- List tools required
    Micro-USB cable
    Laptop for flashing firmware
    jumper wires 



### Implementation
For Software:
The ESP8266 is programmed to scan and jam Wi-Fi networks in range (educational/demo purposes only, of course). When a device tries to connect, a captive portal triggers and redirects the user to our custom meme webpage hosted on the ESP32. The meme page is pure HTML/JS, designed to make people laugh at their lack of internet instead of crying.
# Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NANDU-SK-004/useless_project_temp.git
cd useless_project_temp

 Install required libraries in Arduino IDE
 - ESPAsyncWebServer
 - ESPAsyncTCP (for ESP8266) / AsyncTCP (for ESP32)
 - WiFi library (comes built-in)

Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE
Select the correct Board and Port in Tools menu


# Run
Connect your ESP32/ESP8266 via USB
Click 'Upload' in Arduino IDE to flash the code
Open Serial Monitor to check logs

 Once running:
 - Access the Web Host via the IP shown in Serial Monitor
 - User's will redirect to the page 
 - Use Wi-Fi scan page to detect and deauth networks (if enabled)
